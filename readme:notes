Plan:

what is not static (make components from these):
- Blog could update
- Main image - scrolling images
- How to get involved (maybe could add?)

Components :
main app:
- blog objects
    -(new blog, edit blog)
- get involved objects
    -(new get involved, edit get involved)
- main image w/ link objects?
  -(new image w/ description, edit image/description)

Plan:
- start with Main Image/Landing objects
    - properties: image, brief description, link
